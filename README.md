# Pulgamecanica's blog

This project started in 2022, I wanted to develop my own personal blog.
Although the arquitechture is more like a social network. But I restricted the users (authors) and there is only one author (the admin) for now.

    Tags can should have a name, icon and a color. The icon needs to be an svg, you should copy the svg content directly.
    The color will be the background of the tag, and the name will be displayed along the icon.
